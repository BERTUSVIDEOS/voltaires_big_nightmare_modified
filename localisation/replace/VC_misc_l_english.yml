 PEACE_OF_CREMONA: "The Peace of Cremona"
 PEACE_OF_CREMONA_DESC: "The Peace of Cremona put an end to the last and most devastating conflict between Milan and Venice for dominance in Northern Italy, leaving the peninsula scorched by fickle condottieri who have exploited the chaos to carve our their own states. To the south, Pope Eugenius IV and the Council of Florence grapple with the schismatic Council of Basel and its recent election of a retired Savoyard Duke as Antipope Felix V.\nMeanwhile, Friedrich III von Habsburg, having succeeded the late Emperor Sigismund as King of the Romans, attempts to assert his power over the other Habsburg lines and against the Hussite nobility in Bohemia who have repeatedly refused to recognize Habsburg claimaints to their throne."
 RISE_OF_THE_OTTOMANS: "Old Zürich War"
 RISE_OF_THE_OTTOMANS_DESC: "When Friedrich VII von Toggenburg died without issue in 1436, his newly-carved estates were claimed by various Swiss and Swabian nobles. As bits of Toggenburger land hemorrhaged away over the next few years, the final conflict came down to the Swiss canton of Zürich versus Schwyz and Glarus. War broke out between the factions in 1443, drawing in powerful forces from around Europe, including the King of France and the Holy Roman Emperor himself...\n\nIn late 1444, the French forces were decisively defeated at the Battle of Sankt Jacob an der Birs, leading France to abandon the war effort in favor of Zürich's other ally Archduke Sigismund of Further Austria."
 string_start_papal_state: "The §YPapal State§! is the collection of lands under the rule of Bishop of Rome, the §YPope§! himself. Being a religious man, His Holiness is not able to focus all his energies on secular matters, and most of the Papal State's territories have managed to assert a startling level of autonomy for themselves. If the Papacy does nothing to curb these cities' autonomy, they could slip out of Rome's grasp entirely.\n\nHis Holiness has far greater challenges ahead of him than upstart leaders of Italian communes, however. As the head of the §YCatholic§! faith, the Pope has a unique responsibility to protect the faith and spread the Word of God far beyond the confines of the Papal States' worldly borders. To the north across the Adriatic Sea, §YVenice§! threatens the balance of power in Italy, and left unchecked could expand from its beachhead in Ravenna. Further north, the venerable monastic states of the §YTeutonic Order§! and §YHospitaller Order§!, tasked by the Church with serving as Christendom's bulwarks against heathens, hold a patchwork of endowments within the §YHoly Roman Empire§!, and left unsupported could be extinguished entirely. Most worrying of all, dark murmurs are beginning to spread, speaking ill not just of the Pope, but of the entire structure of the Catholic Church! These muttered calls for some sort of §YReformation§!, left unchecked, could spell disaster for the Papacy.\n\nAll the diplomatic skills of the Pope should not be used purely in reaction to events, of course. With all the power and prestige of the Church supporting him, His Holiness could wipe out the remnants of the §YApostolic§! movements Fraticellism and Waldensianism, and ensure Catholics reign supreme. He can also win over Catholic Princes to abandon the cause of §YAntipope Felix V§! and end the Basel-Florence schism."
 string_start_tag_europe: "As the High Renaissance approaches, §YItaly§! and §YGermany§! remain fraught by the constant friction between the §YEmperor§! and the many autonomous princes. With the death of the last Luxemburg Emperor Sigismund in 1437, the §YHabsburgs§! are poised to be the new continual holder of the Holy Roman Imperial throne, though §YFriedrich III§! of Styria is having trouble managing his own familial holdings. His younger relatives in Further and Inner Austria are being raised under his uneasy regency, but the §YHussites§! remain strong in Bohemia, having turned it into a de-facto noble oligarchy under the §YLandfryd§! alliance.\n\nMajor wars between §YVenice§! and §YMilan§! in the south and between the §YBurgundian Netherlands§! and the §YHanseatic League§! in the north have just wrapped up, but conflict could break out again at any moment as the ascendant Doges and Dukes look for ever more power.\n\nWith the §YBasel-Florence Schism§! raging, the entire continent is on the verge of major changes, and it will be up to you to lead the §Y[Root.GetAdjective]§! [Root.GovernmentName] through this period."
 string_start_europe_description: "Europe is home to the §YHoly Roman Empire§!, a giant, but largely divided, Empire that dominates the §YGerman§! and §YNorthern Italian§! regions. Upon the death of an §YEmperor§! the §YImperial Electors§! select his replacement by voting. A member can become an Elector by being granted an Electorate by the current Emperor or inheriting an Elector.\n\nCountries within the Holy Roman Empire are allowed their own diplomacy and can even have their own subjects, but the Emperor is obligated to defend them from outside forces and can demand that they hand back §YUnlawfully Acquired Territory§! within the Empire.\n\nWhile the §YAuthority§! of the Emperor is currently low, this may change if the Emperor can strengthen his hold through §YImperial Reforms§!.\n\n[Root.start_imperial_cities_description]Northern Italy is also technically a part of the Holy Roman Empire, but the region has been slipping out of Imperial control for a long time. If the Emperor does not strengthen his hold over Italy within the next few decades the Italian states will be considered independent of the Empire.\n\n"

 string_start_government_republic: "§YRepublics§! elect their §YRulers§! from a selection of 3 candidates, for a term duration (usually 4 years). As long as you keep electing the same ruler this ruler will see his §YMonarch Skills§! increase over time, but you will also hurt your §YRepublican Tradition§!.\n\nIf Republican Tradition becomes too low, the state will risk descending into a §YDictatorship§!.\n\n[Root.startup_government_tribal][Root.startup_government_trade_league][Root.startup_government_factions][Root.startup_government_parliaments]"
 string_start_bavaria: "In [GetYear], the §YWittelsbach§! Duchy of §YBavaria§! lies divided. Split in the 14th century between the sons of Ludwig IV and again among those of Stephan II, four sub-duchies were eventually formed: §YMunich§!, §YLandshut§!, §YIngolstadt§! and §YStraubing§!. However, the Straubing line became extinct in 1425, and its possessions fell to Munich. The three remaining sub-duchies, although joined by family ties, will ever seek the right opportunity to acquire the lands of their kin.\n\n To the south and east, the Habsburgs of §YAustria§! - Emperors of the §YHoly Roman Empire§! - seek to assert their dominance over their neighbors in §YHungary§!, §YBohemia§! and §YItaly§!. They have often been rivals of the Wittelsbach family, which last held the Holy Roman Empire in 1347 - heady days when the likes of §YBrandenburg§!, §YHolland§! and §YTirol§! too were Wittelsbach possessions. As the tide appears to be turning in their favor, we must decide whether to accept this and follow the tide, or whether we should resist this and seek to end Habsburg dominance over the Empire.\n\nTo the north, the Electoral §YPalatinate§! is also ruled by a branch of the Wittelsbach family, the result of an even earlier familial division. If we can unite Bavaria, we should be strong enough to take them on - and if we are lucky, claim their seat on the Electoral College for ourselves."
 string_start_hanseatic: "The cities of §YLübeck§!, §YKöln§!, §YGoslar§!, §YDortmund§!, §YNordhausen§!, and §YHamburg§! are all members of the venerable §YHanseatic League§!, a once-mighty confederation of trade interests along the §YBaltic Sea§! which has since fallen on hard times. Although these Hanseatic cities do not enjoy the majesty and riches they once had, they still have considerable mercantile power at their disposal, and their treasuries are nothing to scoff at.\n\nAlthough the Hanseatic cities still have some muscle, they have much to do if they wish to restore the old glory of the Hansa.\n\nThe free cities of the League owe their allegiance to the §YHoly Roman Emperor§! and enjoy “Imperial Immediacy”, able to deal directly with the Imperial court rather than working through various regional organs. Although the Holy Roman Empire guarantees the independence of the Hanseatic cities for now, any effort to centralize the Empire could become a dire threat to the future of the cities and to the League."
 string_start_reichsritter: "The §YImperial Knights§! were a collective of small landowners in the §YHoly Roman Empire§! who had the status of Immediacy but were not considered Imperial Estates because they had no representation in the Reichstag. They had to band together into Knightly Cantons which were in turn organized into three loosely allied Knightly Circles, the §YSwabian Circle§!, §YFranconian Circle§!, and §YRhenish Circle§!.\n\nIn the 1440s, various Knights were involved in wars or feuds with the Empire's §YFree Cities§!, including the §YWaldenfels Feud§! in which the Franconian Waldenfels family tried to avenge their humiliation by Nüremberg, and the §YHegauer War§! in which a grand alliance of Swabian city-states attempted to break the power of the local Lupfen family and their Knightly allies in Hegau.\n\nThe Knightly Cantons are not states in the traditional sense, and will have to reign in the power of their autonomous nobles and independent and often scattered provinces if they wish to be competitive with other Princes of the Empire."
 string_start_swiss_confederacy: "In [GetYear], the region that would become known as Switzerland was dominated by the §YOld Swiss Confederacy§!, a close alliance of republican 'Cantons' that had emerged out of various Swiss cities and their §YAssociates§! including noble and theocratic states. The Confederacy has gradually broken the power of the §YHabsburg Dynasty§! and indeed captured their ancestral castle in Aargau, but the Habsburgs still cling to a few possessions, most significantly the Thurgau on the coast of Bodensee.\n\nThough the Confederacy is nominally an equal arrangement, the largest and most powerful Canton, §YBern§!, was its de-facto leader, especially in the period of conflict with §YZürich§! that broke out in the mid-fifteenth century.\n\nThe quick §YWar of the Toggenburg Succession§! in late 1440 saw Zürich fail to claim the lands of the extinct Toggenburg family against the protest of Glarus and the House of Raron. Zürich, however, was not so easily discouraged and plotted with the Habsburgs and other foreign powers in what would become known as the §YOld Zürich War§!. The fate and strength of the Confederacy lies in the decisions made by its members and neighbors in these coming years."

 string_start_palatinate: "When Elector-Palatine Ruprecht the Righteous died in 1410, he divided his lands between his four sons, establishing §YPalatinate-Heidelberg§!, §YPalatinate-Zweibrücken§!, §YPalatinate-Mosbach§!, and §YPalatinate-Neumarkt§!. Zweibrücken was soon divided further into Zweibrücken and §YPalatinate-Simmern§!.\n\nIt will take a skilled diplomat and commander to reunite the lands of the Counts Palatine of the Rhine and defeat the other minor Rhenish powers like the Raugraves, Rheingraves, and Knightly Cantons."
 string_start_wurttemberg: "In April 1441, upon the marriage of Ulrich von Württemberg, the §YCounty of Württemberg§! was divided between Ulrich and his brother Ludwig along the Neckar River. The division was only meant to be temporary, but the later Treaty of Nürtingen made it permanent and established slightly different borders, creating §YWürttemberg-Stuttgart§! and §YWürttemberg-Urach§!.\n\nTo complicate matters further, Ulrich and Ludwig's mother Henriette de Montbéliard was still ruling as suo-jure §YCountess of Montbéliard§! until early 1444 with her children as her heirs, laying the groundwork for a §YWürttemberg-Montbéliard§! branch."
 string_start_lorraine: "In [GetYear], §YRené de Valois§! is Count of Anjou, Provence, and Bar, jure-uxoris Duke of Lorraine, and erstwhile King of Naples. The so-called 'Good King's authority in Naples collapsed after a recent Aragonese invasion, leaving Provence as his only direct fief within the §YHoly Roman Empire§!.\nIn §YLorraine§!, sovereign rights are still held by his wife Isabelle de Metz, suo-jure Duchess as daughter of the last male scion of the ancient Ardennes-Metz dynasty.\n\nThough he must wait until her death to formally adopt the Ducal title, her child §YJean de Valois§! has already been installed at Nancy, and only a miracle will allow the prestigious Metz name to live on in Upper Lotharingia."
 string_start_dauphine: "The §YDauphine§! region is in a curious state in [GetYear]. When the original Dauphins of Viennois sold their territory to the King of France in 1349, they included many stipulations to ensure its autonomy and its status as an appanage legally separate from the French crown. Due to its unique prerogatives, combined with its distance from the royal capital and the neglect of its administrators, Dauphine has fallen into a state of feudal anarchy in which local bishops and robber barons reign supreme.\n\nBy the §YTreaty of Cusset§! which ended the noble §YPraguerie§! revolt in July of 1440, the young prince §YLouis de Valois§! won control of the province from his father §YCharles VII§!, becoming the first French heir to actually directly administer the appanage.\n\nLouis, nicknamed 'The Universal Spider' for his constant scheming and ambition, must make sweeping reforms to ensure the integrity of Dauphine and address the lingering question of the §YHoly Roman Empire§!'s suzerainty, which has not yet been formally abolished. The following decades could either see Dauphine decisively integrated into the French royal domain or split off as an Imperial state under a new Valois cadet branch."

 string_start_naples: "After the §YSicilian§! Rebellion of 1282, the §YNeapolitan§! King §YCharles§! of §YAnjou§! lost control of the island to §YPeter III§! of §YAragon§!. With only the territories in mainland Italy to his name, the Kingdom of §YSicily§! Became forfeit and its King adopted the title: the Kingdom of §YNaples§!. \n\n When Queen §YJoan I§! died childless, the Neapolitan Kingdom fell into a constant state of civil war; with cousins of all kinds of claims and titles to their name fighting for control of the Kingdom. \n\nIn [GetYear], the Kingdom of Naples is a captive in a very delicate situation. §YAlfonso§! of Aragon is attempting to centralize his control of the Kingdom contra its erstwhile Angevin King §YRené§!, but his claim to the throne is weak and the question of who truly belongs on the throne is something of an ongoing dispute. With blood ties to the Kingdom of §YFrance§!, the Neapolitan Succession Crisis has become a matter of great tension between Aragon and France. \n\nTo the north, the §YPapal State§! controls §YRome§! and much of Central Italy. Meanwhile, the Italian Peninsula is shattered into small realms such as §YFlorence§! and city-states like §YLucca§!. However, the question still remains: how will Naples break free from the iron grasp of Aragonese rule and reunite the §YTwo Sicilies§!?"
