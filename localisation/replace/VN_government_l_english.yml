 harem_events.1.dd:0 "His Imperial Majesty [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], sovereign of the house of [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName], Sultan of Sultans and Khan of Khans, has a reputation as a great man and is unchallenged as a ruler.\nAs befits a man of his caliber and stature the Sultan has fathered several capable children and many who show great promise as future rulers. Both the sons themselves and our government officials are acutely aware that only one can inherit and what awaits the others. Our Viziers are adamant that it is now high time for [Root.Monarch.GetName] to name a favorite among the possible successors. This is unlikely to end the competition for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] favor but it will hopefully stop the worst succession struggles that might follow if our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] should meet his maker without having picked a clear successor."

 harem_events.2.d:0 "A Turkish coronation ceremony is the most grand thing many will see in their lifetime and the coronation of [Root.Monarch.GetName] is no exception. As the sword of our founder is girded upon [Root.Monarch.GetName] by the Sharif of [Root.Capital.GetName], however, our Viziers look upon [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] with some amount of dread. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] was never the most likely of candidates and would likely never have taken the throne if a clear favorite had existed.\nSome would go as far as to say that it was [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] mediocrity that allowed [Root.Monarch.GetName] to triumph. Greater men never considered [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] a threat and others hoped to control the Empire through [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. One thing our new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has clearly demonstrated:0 When the need arises [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will not shy away from sinking a dagger in the back of those that trust [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]."
