 holy_orders_estate_events.2.d: "It has been a while now since we sent [Root.Heir.GetName] to the members of the $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ to educate [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] in their abilities. In [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] months of hard training, [Root.Heir.GetName] has not only seen a lot of the world, but has also been able to improve [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] administrative and fighting skills, culminating in an increased level of humbleness to our religion. We should sincerely thank the $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ for taking care of the training of our [Root.Heir.GetTitle] so diligently and making [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] an exemplary knight."
 holy_orders_estate_events.2.a: "Reward them generously"
 holy_orders_estate_events.2.b: "That was their job, after all"

 holy_orders_estate_events.3.d: "Not only the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ takes over the administration of our provinces, but also the $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ of [Root.GetName] excel by their modern methods. They particularly insist on preserving newly conquered territory so that they can take special care of the conversion of heretics and heathens.

 holy_orders_estate_events.4.d: "The $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ have gained considerable influence at the [Root.GetAdjective] court in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] in the past years, often providing advisors to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and dominating state affairs today. Even the Holy Father himself has heard of this and has thus passed a decree granting a special position to the $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$, freeing them from [Root.GetAdjective] jurisdiction and placing them directly under the authority of the Catholic Church. This means a massive intervention in our internal politics!"

An influential knight, who is an excellent fighter not only in jousting, insists on being elevated to the rank of baron by [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], as he, being a bastard, has no inheritance rights. While the $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ support him in this - hoping for political advantages by doing so - the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ vigorously rejects this, as they fear for their own power.

But the route to get there is many hundreds, if not thousands of kilometers long, often leading through rough terrain. To make matters worse, the pilgrims will probably have to cross lands where Christians are unwanted, possibly even persecuted. The $ESTATE_HOLY_ORDERS$ of [Root.GetName] however, offer to accompany the travellers to Jerusalem and protect them with their swords from potential danger."

Quite blatantly, they are expressing their aversion to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and denying their loyalty to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim].

In many places, the courage and bravery of our knights are appreciated, whose chivalrousness is also exceptional and outstanding.

 estate_jews_tolerance_desc: "Discrimination and prejudice based on religious divisions cause the Jews great suffering. We must cast off our differences and come together to truly unite the state if we are to unlock our people's full potential."
 estate_jews_guaranteed_autonomy_desc: "Guaranteeing the Jews freedom from government interference will ease the burdens of our administration and be sure to make them more supportive of our rule."
 estate_jews_indebted_to_jews: "Indebted to the $ESTATE_NAME$"
 estate_jews_indebted_to_jews_desc: "The Jews are willing to offer cheap loans to the [Root.GovernmentName] in return for greater religious freedom. However, this would undermine the reputation of our Christian realm."
 estate_jews_expulsion: "Expell the $ESTATE_NAME$"
 estate_jews_expulsion_desc: "Since the time of King Tiglath in the eighth century BC, the Jews have been forcibly expelled from many nations, usually as a scapegoat or as an excuse to confiscate their property. As godfearing Christians, we can continue this ancient tradition by demanding all Jews leave [Root.GetName] immediately."
 estate_jews_expulsion_effect_tooltip: "The §YJews§! Estate will be §RPERMANENTLY§! removed from our nation."
 estate_jews_grant_liberties: "Grant Jewish Liberties"
 estate_jews_grant_liberties_desc: "The Jews are a minority faction in our state with the power of the majority of the heathens within our borders. By granting them some liberties we can secure their loyalty to us."
#Jews Events
 estate_privileges_and_agendas_events.3.m: "The Proposal of the Jews"
 estate_disasters.8.t: "The Jews Break Free"
 estate_disasters.8.d: "Jewish leaders have come to exercise such far-ranging authority over large areas of our state that it has now come to the point where the $MONARCHTITLE$ has had to accept that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] no longer has any practical control over them. With the crowning of a leader of their own the transition is complete and our loss of authority over the Jews total." 
 estate_disasters.8.a: "We should have seen this coming..."
 estate_disasters.8.b: "The future lies with them!"
 jews_estate_events.1.t: "Overzealous Inquisitor"
 jews_estate_events.1.d: "An Inquisitor in one of our major cities has been using his influence to interpret canon law as well as the edicts of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] a bit too zealously. Not content to keep the status quo in the largely Jewish city he has been trying to actively force the Jews to convert while systematically closing down their synagogues.\nAfter a recent suicide by a force-converted trader Jews are now leaving the city en masse to settle somewhere more welcoming. While even the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ largely seem to find these actions too extreme they would likely consider any action taken against the Inquisitor to be much worse."
 jews_estate_events.1.a: "Stand by the Inquisitor."
 jews_estate_events.1.b: "Replace the Inquisitor and try to make amends."
 jews_estate_events.2.t: "Demands to lessen Taxes on Jews"
 jews_estate_events.2.d: "As our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was on his way to the weekly procession to the royal Cathedral a large number of Jews had assembled in front of the building, preventing the passage of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and demanding that some of the discriminatory taxes against Jews such as the temple or ghetto taxes be revoked."
 jews_estate_events.3.d: "While not everyone may like it the Jews in our realm have been growing in influence over the last few years. Jews are frequently seen even among the more important Trade Guilds of our country and many serve as administrators in our provinces or have been allowed to keep their hereditary titles."
 jews_estate_events.4.t: "Marginalization of the Jews"
 jews_estate_events.4.d: "While they make up an important part of our society the Jews have lately been losing ground to other groups. They are regularly looked over for any type of government service, have to pay a number of discriminatory taxes and often see business deals going to their Christian competitors."
 jews_estate_events.5.t: "The Jews and the $ESTATE_NOBLES$"
 jews_estate_events.5.d: "Many among the Christian $ESTATE_NOBLES$ have been voicing complaints at what they feel is an unjust and unfair favoring of Jews in our government. Having sought the support of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ they now claim that we are running our country contrary to established Christian customs and that we must ensure that the Jews are kept out of positions of influence.\nThe construction of a new synagogue in a city largely dominated by the Jews entirely funded by local nobles and merchants has escalated the situation further with the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ and the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ demanding that we tear down the holy building and put the Jews in their place."
 jews_estate_events.5.b: "Stand by the Jews."
 jews_estate_events.6.t: "Jewish Administrators"
 jews_estate_events.6.d: "Traditionally the Jews are excluded from service in many of the higher positions in the administration. Instead these are generally given to faithful Christian literati. As our government apparatus grows, however, it has a constant thirst for more learned men and among the Jews there are many that would fit this description. While some would consider it unorthodox we could probably greatly benefit from recruiting from their numbers."
 jews_estate_events.7.t: "Blood Libel"
 jews_estate_events.7.d: "The quickly deteriorating relations between the state and the Jews have resulted in local relations breaking down entirely in some areas. Rabble rousers tell tales of Christian children vanishing on the route through city districts dominated by the Jews, allegedly having been abducted to make Matza out of their blood. In these cities the Rabbis and other community leaders of the Jews protest against these rumors and it has become increasingly hard to keep track of who is telling the truth. Even those opposed to Jewish influence now find that they question our ability to maintain order."
 jews_estate_events.7.a: "Start a pogrom!"
 jews_estate_events.8.t: "Riches of the Jews"
 jews_estate_events.8.d: "Theoretically the Jews receive state protection and certain legal privileges despite being barred from many of the realm's other traditional legal processes and rights.\nWhile this may seem unfortunate for them it is quite fortunate for us right now, while the general economy is currently still recovering from recent wars many Jewish families still hold quite large cash reserves and they have no laws or rules forbidding them from investing or lending it to others."
 jews_estate_events.8.a: "Convince the Jews to invest in economic recovery."
 jews_estate_events.8.b: "We must not make ourselves dependent on Jews."
 jews_estate_events.9.t: "Revolt of the [Root.GetName] Jews"
 jews_estate_events.9.d: "Desperate to have their privileges redacted the Jews of [Root.GetName] have taken up arms against us!"
